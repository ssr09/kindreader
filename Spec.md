**Project Spec: KindReader (Extension Version)**

---

# üåê Goal
Build a browser extension where users can:
1. Extract **reader-friendly** (main text + images) version of any webpage.
2. **Read aloud** the content using customizable voices.
3. **Translate** the content into different languages.
4. **Rewrite** the page in fun styles (simplified, pirate language, playful).
5. Provide a **Child-Safe** mode that:
   - Filters bad words (Image moderation parked for later phase)
6. Apply **Themes** (Day, Night, Sepia) to the reader view.
7. View **Page Stats** (estimated reading time, page category like Games, Streaming, Social Media, etc.)
